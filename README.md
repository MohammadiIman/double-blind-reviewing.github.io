# Double-blind reviewing status of CS conferences

This document tracks the status of major computer science conferences
(currently defined as those listed in [CSrankings](http://csrankings.org)) with
respect to how they maintain anonymity during the reviewing process;
it is curated by [Emery Berger](https://emeryberger.com). For additions or updates,
please post an issue or pull request [on its GitHub repository](https://github.com/double-blind-reviewing/double-blind-reviewing.github.io).

For the purposes of this document:

* _Single-blind_ means that author identities and affiliations are visible
to reviewers at all points during the reviewing process.

* _At least partially double-blind_ means that author identities and
affiliations are not revealed for papers prior to the submission of
_initial_ paper reviews.

* _Fully double-blind_ means that "double-blind to accept" is
employed.  That is, author identities and affiliations are not
revealed until the conclusion of the PC meeting, and only for accepted
papers (including conditionally-accepted papers, pending modifications
due to shepherding). In cases where the CFP does not explicitly state
the use of full double-blind reviewing, this status has been verified directly
with the program chair(s).
